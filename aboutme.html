  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>Hi there! Yes, you there. My name is Anna Francis. To briefly introduce myself to you, I live in Connecticut with my parents and younger sister. Oh, and we also have a dog too. Our golden retriever named Molly is very sweet - I think you'd like her a lot. I go to school in Vermont and have my sights set Vassar or Wesleyan for college. I am very excited to have enrolled in the Girls Who Code program and look forward to the rest of the summer. I like listining to Alternative Indie, funk rock, and art rock music, but I dislike listening to rap and country music. Oops. A fun fact about me is that I enjoy woodworking and built a pintograph and a ukulele in my school's woods shop.</p>
  <p>Here is one of my favorite websites! Check it out</p>

  <p>As you can see, it is very satisfying.<p/>
  <p>Yesterday, I created a multiplayer Paddle Ball game in Scratch. Check it out below!</p>
