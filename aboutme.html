  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <h2 class="intro">By Anna Francis</h2>
  
    <body>
  <p>Hi there! Yes, you there. My name is Anna Francis. To briefly introduce myself to you, I live in Connecticut with my parents and younger sister. Oh, and we also have a dog too. Our golden retriever named Molly is very sweet - I think you'd like her a lot. I like listening to alternative indie, funk rock, and art rock music, but I dislike listening to rap and country music. Oops. A fun fact about me is that I enjoy woodworking. Last year, I built a pintograph and a ukulele in my school's woods shop. I am very excited to have enrolled in the Girls Who Code program and look forward to the rest of the summer. Besides learning a bit of Processing before and coding my pintograph on Desmos, I have little experience with coding. So far, I enjoy it very much. </p>
  <h3>Here is one of my favorite websites! Check it out</h3>
